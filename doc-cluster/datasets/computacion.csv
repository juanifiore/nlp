1974,"Recently, increasing attention has been directed to the study of the emotional content of speech signals, and hence, many systems have been proposed to identify the emotional content of a spoken utterance.",background,0
1975,This paper is a survey of speech emotion classification addressing three important aspects of the design of a speech emotion recognition system.,background,0
1976,The first one is the choice of suitable features for speech representation.,background,0
1977,The second issue is the design of an appropriate classification scheme and the third issue is the proper preparation of an emotional speech database for evaluating system performance.,background,0
1978,Conclusions about the performance and limitations of current speech emotion recognition systems are discussed in the last section of this survey.,background,0
1979,This section also suggests possible ways of improving speech emotion recognition systems.,method,2

1981,"Recurrent neural networks are a powerful tool for modeling sequential data, but the dependence of each timestep’s computation on the previous timestep’s output limits parallelism and makes RNNs unwieldy for very long sequences.",background,0
1982,"We introduce quasi-recurrent neural networks (QRNNs), an approach to neural sequence modeling that alternates convolutional layers, which apply in parallel across timesteps, and a minimalist recurrent pooling function that applies in parallel across channels.",method,2
1983,"Despite lacking trainable recurrent layers, stacked QRNNs have better predictive accuracy than stacked LSTMs of the same hidden size.",method,2
1984,"Due to their increased parallelism, they are up to 16 times faster at train and test time.",result,3
1985,"Experiments on language modeling, sentiment classification, and character-level neural machine translation demonstrate these advantages and underline the viability of QRNNs as a basic building block for a variety of sequence tasks.",result,3
1986,"Directed links in social media could represent anything from intimate friendships to common interests, or even a passion for breaking news or celebrity gossip.",background,0
1987,Such directed links determine the flow of information and hence indicate a user’s influence on others—a concept that is crucial in sociology and viral marketing.,background,0
1988,"In this paper, using a large amount of data collected from Twitter, we present an in-depth comparison of three measures of influence: indegree, retweets, and mentions.",background,0
1989,"Based on these measures, we investigate the dynamics of user influence across topics and time.",objective,1
1990,We make several interesting observations.,method,2
1991,"First, popular users who have high indegree are not necessarily influential in terms of spawning retweets or mentions.",objective,1
1992,"Second, most influential users can hold significant influence over a variety of topics.",result,3
1993,"Third, influence is not gained spontaneously or accidentally, but through concerted effort such as limiting tweets to a single topic.",method,2
1994,We believe that these findings provide new insights for viral marketing and suggest that topological measures such as indegree alone reveals very little about the influence of a user.,result,3
1995,"Design thinking (DT) is regarded as a system of three overlapping spaces—viability, desirability, and feasibility—where innovation increases when all three perspectives are addressed.",background,0
1996,Understanding how innovation within teams can be supported by DT methods and tools captivates the interest of business communities.,background,0
1997,This paper aims to examine how DT methods and tools foster innovation in teams.,objective,1
1998,"A case study approach, based on two workshops, examined three DT methods with a software tool.",result,3
1999,The findings support the use of DT methods and tools as a way of incubating ideas and creating innovative solutions within teams when team collaboration and software limitations are balanced.,result,3
2000,The paper proposes guidelines for utilizing DT methods and tools in innovation,result,3
2001,"Designing convolutional neural networks (CNN) models for mobile devices is challenging because mobile models need to be small and fast, yet still accurate.",background,0
2002,"Although significant effort has been dedicated to design and improve mobile models on all three dimensions, it is challenging to manually balance these trade-offs when there are so many architectural possibilities to consider.",background,0
2003,"In this paper, we propose an automated neural architecture search approach for designing resourceconstrained mobile CNN models.",objective,1
2004,We propose to explicitly incorporate latency information into the main objective so that the search can identify a model that achieves a good trade-off between accuracy and latency.,objective,1
2005,"Unlike in previous work, where mobile latency is considered via another, often inaccurate proxy (e.g., FLOPS), in our experiments, we directly measure real-world inference latency by executing the model on a particular platform, e.g., Pixel phones.",method,2
2006,"To further strike the right balance between flexibility and search space size, we propose a novel factorized hierarchical search space that permits layer diversity throughout the network.",method,2
2007,Experimental results show that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art mobile CNN models across multiple vision tasks.,result,3
2008,"On the ImageNet classification task, our model achieves 74.0% top-1 accuracy with 76ms latency on a Pixel phone, which is 1.5× faster than MobileNetV2 (Sandler et al. 2018) and 2.4× faster than NASNet (Zoph et al. 2018) with the same top-1 accuracy.",result,3
2009,"On the COCO object detection task, our model family achieves both higher mAP quality and lower latency than MobileNets.",result,3
2010,This paper describes the implementation of general multibody system dynamics on Scissor lift Mechanism (i.e. four bar parallel mechanism) within a bond graph modeling framework.,background,0
2011,Scissor lifting mechanism is the first choice for automobiles and industries for elevation work.,method,2
2012,The system has a one degree of freedom.,background,0
2013,"There are several procedures for deriving dynamic equations of rigid bodies in classical mechanics (i.e. Classic Newton-D'Alembert, Newton-Euler, Lagrange, Hamilton, kanes to name a few).",method,2
2014,But these are labor-intensive for large and complicated systems thereby error prone.,background,0
2015,Here the multibody dynamics model of the mechanism is developed in bond graph formalism because it offers flexibility for modeling of closed loop kinematic systems without any causal conflicts and control laws can be included.,method,2
2016,"In this work, the mechanism is modeled and simulated in order to evaluate several application-specific requirements such as dynamics, position accuracy etc.",method,2
2017,The proposed multibody dynamics model of the mechanism offers an accurate and fast method to analyze the dynamics of the mechanism knowing that there is no such work available for scissor lifts.,method,2
2018,The simulation gives a clear idea about motor torque sizing for different link lengths of the mechanism over a linear displacement.,result,3
2019,Android is a modern and popular software platform for smartphones.,background,0
2020,Among its predominant features is an advanced security model which is based on application-oriented mandatory access control and sandboxing.,background,0
2021,This allows developers and users to restrict the execution of an application to the privileges it has (mandatorily) assigned at installation time.,background,0
2022,The exploitation of vulnerabilities in program code is hence believed to be confined within the privilege boundaries of an application’s sandbox.,background,0
2023,"However, in this paper we show that a privilege escalation attack is possible.",objective,1
2024,We show that a genuine application exploited at runtime or a malicious application can escalate granted permissions.,objective,1
2025,Our results immediately imply that Android’s security model cannot deal with a transitive permission usage attack and Android’s sandbox model fails as a last resort against malware and sophisticated runtime attacks.,result,3
