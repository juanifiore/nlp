1306,"The miner also preserves a private and secure BC, used for controlling and auditing communications.",method,2
1307,"We show that our proposed BC-based smart home framework is secure by thoroughly analysing its security with respect to the fundamental security goals of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.",method,2
1308,"Finally, we present simulation results to highlight that the overheads (in terms of traffic, processing time and energy consumption) introduced by our approach are insignificant relative to its security and privacy gains.",result,3
1309,Exaggeration of facial expressions is used in animation and robotics to intensify emotions.,background,0
1310,"However, modifying a human-like face can lead to an unsettling outcome.",background,0
1311,This phenomenon is known as uncanny valley.,background,0
1312,The goal of this study was to identify the realism level and magnitude of facial expression that produce the maximum amount of emotional intensity and the minimum amount of perceived strangeness.,objective,1
1313,We studied the perceived intensity of emotion and perceived strangeness of faces with varying levels of realism (from schematic to photorealistic) and magnitude of facial expressions (from neutral to extremely exaggerated).,method,2
1314,We found that less realistic faces required more exaggeration to reach the emotional intensity of a real human face.,result,3
1315,"While there is a range of emotional intensity that can be expressed by real human faces (from neutral to full intensity), we found that the same range of emotional intensity could be expressed by artificial faces when exaggeration was used.",result,3
1316,"However, attempts to express emotional intensities outside this range using exaggeration led to strange-looking faces at all levels of realism.",result,3
1317,The recent research on the CVRP is being slowed down by the lack of a good set of benchmark instances.,background,0
1318,"The existing sets suffer from at least one of the following drawbacks: (i) became too easy for current algorithms; (ii) are too artificial; (iii) are too homogeneous, not covering the wide range of characteristics found in real applications.",background,0
1319,"We propose a new set of instances ranging from 100 to 1000 customers, designed in order to provide a more comprehensive and balanced experimental setting.",objective,1
1320,We report results with state-of-the-art exact and heuristic methods.,method,2
1321,"Many modern robotics applications require robots to function autonomously in dynamic environments including other decision making agents, such as people or other robots.",background,0
1322,This calls for fast and scalable interactive motion planning.,background,0
1323,This requires models that take into consideration the other agent's intended actions in one's own planning.,background,0
1324,We present a real-time motion planning framework that brings together a few key components including intention inference by reasoning counterfactually about potential motion of the other agents as they work towards different goals.,method,2
1325,"By using a light-weight motion model, we achieve efficient iterative planning for fluid motion when avoiding pedestrians, in parallel with goal inference for longer range movement prediction.",method,2
1326,This inference framework is coupled with a novel distributed visual tracking method that provides reliable and robust models for the current belief-state of the monitored environment.,method,2
1327,This combined approach represents a computationally efficient alternative to previously studied policy learning methods that often require significant offline training or calibration and do not yet scale to densely populated environments.,method,2
1328,We validate this framework with experiments involving multi-robot and human-robot navigation.,result,3
1329,We further validate the tracker component separately on much larger scale unconstrained pedestrian data sets.,result,3
1330,Architectural views are at the foundation of software architecture and are used to describe the system from different perspectives.,background,0
1331,"However, some architectural concerns crosscut the decomposition of the architecture in views.",background,0
1332,"The drawbacks of crosscutting with respect to architectural views is similar to the drawbacks with respect to code, i.e. hampering reuse, maintenance and evolution of the architecture.",background,0
1333,"This paper investigates the relations between architectural concerns, architectural drivers and views to identify why crosscutting manifests itself.",objective,1
1334,We propose to extend the architectural description with slices and composition mechanisms to prevent this crosscutting and perform an initial exploration of these concepts in an Online Auction system.,method,2
1335,Within this limited setting the first results look promising to better separate concerns that otherwise would crosscut the views.,result,3
1336,"This paper describes an algorithm to compute the envelope of a set of points in a plane, which generates convex or non-convex hulls that represent the area occupied by the given points.",objective,1
1337,"The proposed algorithm is based on a k-nearest neighbours approach, where the value of k, the only algorithm parameter, is used to control the “smoothness” of the final solution.",method,2
1338,"The obtained results show that this algorithm is able to deal with arbitrary sets of points, and that the time to compute the polygons increases approximately linearly with the number of points.",result,3
1339,Recurrent neural networks are powerful sequence learners.,background,0
1340,"They are able to incorporate context information in a flexible way, and are robust to localised distortions of the input data.",background,0

1342,"Long short-term memory is an especially promising recurrent architecture, able to bridge long time delays between relevant input and output events, and thereby access long range context.",background,0
1343,"The aim of this thesis is to advance the state-of-the-art in supervised sequence labelling with recurrent networks in general, and long short-term memory in particular.",objective,1
1344,"Its two main contributions are (1) a new type of output layer that allows recurrent networks to be trained directly for sequence labelling tasks where the alignment between the inputs and the labels is unknown, and (2) an extension of long short-term memory to multidimensional data, such as images and video sequences.",method,2
1345,"Experimental results are presented on speech recognition, online and offline handwriting recognition, keyword spotting, image segmentation and image classification, demonstrating the advantages of advanced recurrent networks over other sequential algorithms, such as hidden Markov Models.",result,3
1346,"The purposes of this paper are to review the microinstruction sequencing capabilities of several microprogrammed computers; to determine whether these sequencing capabilities permit easy implementation of the control constructs of flowchartable program logic in modular microcode; and to present a set of microinstruction sequencing functions which will support ""structured"" microprogramming.",background,0
1347,Several microprogrammable mini- and microcomputers which provide the user with the means for implementing special purpose instruction sets have been introduced relatively recently.,background,0
1348,"However, the experiments by Weber and Balzer which demonstrated the possibilities for increasing computation speeds, decreasing main memory space usage, and easing the task of applications programming by means of special purpose instruction sets implemented in microcode were performed some time ago.",background,0
